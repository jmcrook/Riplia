## Project Overview

The Vietoris-Rips algorithm is a fundamental tool in topological data analysis that constructs simplicial complexes from point cloud data based on pairwise distances. The implementation includes:

- Building Vietoris-Rips complexes at a specific distance threshold
- Computing filtrations over a range of thresholds
- Supporting higher-dimensional simplices
- Visualizing the complexes
- Basic persistence diagram computation

## Test Results

We've run several tests to validate the implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**: All 22 tests passed, confirming the correctness of the algorithm on simple geometric examples (square and circle).

2. **Example with 20 points (Circle)**: 
   - For ε = 0.5 and max_dim = 2, we got 46 simplices:
     - 20 0-dimensional simplices (vertices)
     - 23 1-dimensional simplices (edges)
     - 3 2-dimensional simplices (triangles)

3. **Larger Test (Torus with 200 points)**:
   - For ε = 0.5 and max_dim = 2, we got 894 simplices:
     - 200 0-dimensional simplices (vertices)
     - 415 1-dimensional simplices (edges)
     - 279 2-dimensional simplices (triangles)

## Benchmark Results

Performance comparison between basic and optimized implementations:

| Points | Basic (s) | Optimized (s) | Speedup |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 50     | 0.000775  | 0.030727      | 0.03x   |
| 100    | 0.017136  | 0.001031      | 16.6x   |
| 150    | 0.067096  | 0.002688      | 25.0x   |

**Filtration computation** (150 points):
- Basic implementation: 1.268272 seconds
- Optimized implementation: 0.050350 seconds
- **Speedup: 25.2x**

These results demonstrate that:
1. For very small point clouds, the basic implementation may be faster due to lower overhead
2. As the point cloud size increases, the optimized implementation becomes significantly faster
3. For filtration computation, the optimized implementation offers substantial performance improvements

## Running the Code

To run this code, you will need to:

1. **Install Julia**: Download from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```julia
   julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add(["Test", "LinearAlgebra", "SparseArrays", "DataStructures", "Plots", "Random", "Printf"])'
   ```

3. **Run the examples**:
   ```bash
   julia vietoris_rips_example.jl     # Basic example with a circle
   julia test_optimized.jl            # Larger example with a torus
   julia benchmark_comparison.jl      # Performance comparison
   ```

4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   julia test_vietoris_rips.jl
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Basic Implementation (`vietoris_rips.jl`)

The basic implementation uses a dense distance matrix and straightforward algorithms to:
1. Build the simplicial complex from 0-simplices up through higher dimensions
2. Generate filtrations at different thresholds

### Optimized Implementation (`vietoris_rips_optimized.jl`)

The optimized version:
1. Uses sparse matrices to reduce memory usage
2. Implements more efficient candidate generation for higher-dimensional simplices
3. Provides persistence computation capabilities for 0-dimensional homology
4. Uses better data structures for large-scale computation

## Performance Considerations

- For small point clouds (< 50 points), the basic implementation may be sufficient
- For larger datasets (> 100 points) or higher-dimensional computations, use the optimized version
- The computational complexity grows exponentially with the maximum dimension of simplices
- Memory usage can be an issue for large datasets with many points
- The optimized implementation shows a 25x speedup for point clouds of 150+ points

## Next Steps

Possible extensions to this implementation:
1. Full persistent homology computation for all dimensions
2. Parallelization for handling large datasets
3. More efficient filtration algorithms
4. Integration with visualization tools for persistence diagrams
